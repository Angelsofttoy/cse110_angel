Hi! I'm _Angel(Yingjie) Ren_, I'm currently a senior with a major in Visual Arts and a minor in Computer Science. 

### ***How I Started Learning Computer Science***

I started learning Computer Science when I first saw this simple line of code at CSE8A:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

These two simple words really draw me into the world of computer science, and also the limitless possibilities it hold to connect with the rest of the world throguh code. 

Apart from learning computer sciences, I also drew a lot of art for my major classes, and they are all here on my [*Instagram page*](https://www.instagram.com/angelsofttoy/).

### ***freetime***

In my free time, I often:

* listen to k-pop/[j-pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_Yw0q8QVFQ)
* watch movies/anime
* do drawings!

In this class, I hope I could learn more about the process of developing softwares and be able to:

- [x] Refamiliarize myself with GitHub
- [ ] Try my best to learn, and to collaborate with classmates!
